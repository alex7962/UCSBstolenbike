## Abstract
  UC Santa Barbara is considered one of the biggest biker friendly campuses in the state of California. Unfortunately every year, more than 400 bikes get reported stolen. Our group's project goal is to build an interactive heatmap based on the data of stolen bikes at UCSB from the year of 2010 to 2017. The heatmap will show users a trend, entailing where more bikes tend to get stolen. We hope to use our project to contribute to the community of UCSB students in a positive light and help them be worry-free from their bikes getting stolen.
